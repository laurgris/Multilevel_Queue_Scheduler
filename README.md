# Traffic_Simulator
### Purpose
This program was designed to simulate a task manager within a PC. It handles specialized "processes" and executes them in a way similar to a computer's own scheduler.

### Contributors
Some code was provided by my instructor, Dr. Jessica Sherette. Dr. Sherette is University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) faculty, where the course was taken. Classes contributed by her are commented as such at the top. This program was developed alongside my partner, [Christian Walker](https://github.com/christianhelp).
